start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command:
	php artisan serve
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

NB THIS IS NOT WORKING.... USE ARTISAN SERVE INSTEAD.
or after starting the xamp server, navigate to htdocs xamp and copy the relative path :
    http://localhost/LARAVEL/Employee-Management-System/public/

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LARAVEL AND (ANGULAR, REACT , ETC)
-laravel is a aserver-side framewwork while angular etc are client side framewwork
-You can not make a single-page app directly
-It can connect with db
-Angular etc cant connect with db directly
-Angular etc need api
-Angular etc need a backend framewwork

Making Controller run:
    php artisan make:controller Users

Making a component (its a piece of code that can be reused eg a header):
    php artisan make:component header

Making MiddleWare(is a piece of code that checks users request. eg at login).. Run:
    php artisan make:middleware ageCheck

Making models(Should be similar to Table name, but in singular tense)
    php artisan make:model User

Making Migrations... "employees" is table name
    php artisan make:migration create_employees

Migrating the migration
    php artisan migrate
